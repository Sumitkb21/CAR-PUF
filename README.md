# Companion Arbiter PUF (CAR-PUF) Linear Model Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the *Introduction to Machine Learning* course. The primary focus of the project was to analyze the security vulnerabilities of the Companion Arbiter PUF (CAR-PUF) by implementing a linear model using logistic regression. The model predicts the responses of CAR-PUFs with high accuracy, showcasing the potential to break the security of such systems.

## Project Highlights

- **Model Implementation**: 
  Successfully derived and implemented a linear model using logistic regression that accurately predicts the responses of a Companion Arbiter PUF with a remarkable accuracy of 99.3%.

- **Mathematical Derivation**: 
  Provided a thorough mathematical derivation to demonstrate that a single linear model can compromise the security of Companion Arbiter PUFs. This reinforces the theoretical foundations of the model and its ability to break CAR-PUF security.

- **Efficiency and Performance**: 
  Demonstrated high efficiency and model performance by reducing the feature vector dimensionality to 528. The model achieved an error rate of 0.009 and a training time of 14.287 seconds, making it both effective and efficient.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 99.1%
- **Error Rate**: 0.009
- **Training Time**: 14.287 seconds
- **Dimensionality**: Reduced feature vector to 528

## Conclusion

The project highlights the potential vulnerabilities of CAR-PUFs when exposed to linear models like logistic regression. By reducing the dimensionality and optimizing the model's performance, this project serves as a proof-of-concept for efficiently breaking CAR-PUF security systems. The results emphasize the importance of revisiting security mechanisms for hardware-based PUFs.
